# Hi there 👋

I'm Henry, a Software Engineer at Amazon.

I work on [Buy with Prime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/). It allows you to 
sell your Prime products through your own website.

When I get free time, you can find me:

- 👨‍💻 Occassionally contributing to open source.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting weights.
- 💰 Studying finance.
- 🍿 Watching Netflix.

I'm always on the hunt to try new things, so drop me a line on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryfraser1/)!
